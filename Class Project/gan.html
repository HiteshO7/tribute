                <b>Mahatma Gandhi</b>, also known as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was an Indian independence
                 activist and a prominent political figure who is widely recognized as the "Father of 
                 the Nation" in India. Born in 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, Gandhi is considered to be 
                 one of the most influential leaders in the history of the Indian independence movement.</br></br>

                 Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence, also known as Satyagraha, played a pivotal role in India's
                  independence from British rule in 1947. He led several non-violent civil disobedience campaigns, 
                  such as the Salt March, and inspired millions of Indians to fight for their freedom.</br></br>
                  Apart from his political activism, Gandhi was also a spiritual leader who promoted the values
                   of simplicity, truth, and self-reliance. He believed in leading a simple and austere life, 
                   and his philosophy of non-violence inspired several other civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr.

            <p class="qw">Biography</p></br></br>
            <p class="sd">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was an Indian political leader and freedom fighter who played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India.

            </br></br> Gandhi was educated in London and became a lawyer. However, he was not interested in practicing law and returned to India in 1915 to join the Indian National Congress, which was fighting for India's independence from British rule.
                
        </br></br>  Gandhi became famous for his use of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of protest. He believed that violence was not the answer to India's problems and that only through peaceful resistance could India achieve its freedom. Gandhi led several campaigns of nonviolent civil disobedience, including the Salt Satyagraha, the Quit India Movement, and the Champaran Satyagraha.
                
    </br></br>  Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence and civil disobedience had a profound impact on the world. He inspired many other freedom movements, including the American Civil Rights Movement and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa.
                
</br></br>   Gandhi was a prolific writer and author of several books, including "The Story of My Experiments with Truth," which is an autobiographical account of his life and philosophy.
                
</br></br>  In 1947, India gained its independence from British colonial rule, and Gandhi became a national hero. However, his dream of a united India was shattered by communal violence between Hindus and Muslims, and he worked tirelessly to promote communal harmony until his death.
                
</br></br>  On January 30, 1948, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist who disagreed with Gandhi's views on communal harmony. Gandhi's death was a great loss to India and the world, and he remains an inspiration to millions of people around the world who believe in his philosophy of nonviolence, peace, and social justice.
