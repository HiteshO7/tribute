            <p class="qw">Biography</p></br></br>
            <p class="sd">Lal Bahadur Shastri was an Indian politician and statesman who served as the second Prime Minister of India from 1964 to 1966. He was born on October 2, 1904, in Mughalsarai, Uttar Pradesh, India, and grew up in a humble family. Shastri's father was a school teacher, and he lost his mother at a young age.</br></br>

                Shastri was deeply influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's teachings and became an active participant in the Indian independence movement. He joined the Indian National Congress in the 1920s and participated in several nonviolent protests and movements.</br></br>
                
                After India gained independence in 1947, Shastri held several important positions in the government, including Minister of Railways and Home Minister. He was known for his honesty, simplicity, and integrity, and was a popular leader among the masses.</br></br>
                
                Shastri became Prime Minister in 1964, following the death of Jawaharlal Nehru. During his brief tenure as Prime Minister, Shastri focused on improving India's economic and agricultural development, and strengthening the country's national security. He famously coined the slogan "Jai Jawan Jai Kisan" (Hail the Soldier, Hail the Farmer) to boost the morale of the Indian armed forces and farmers during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.</br></br>
                
                Shastri's sudden death in 1966, at the age of 61, remains shrouded in controversy. Despite his short tenure, Shastri is widely regarded as one of India's most beloved leaders and is remembered for his dedication to the welfare of the common people and his commitment to peace, justice, and equality.</p></div>
