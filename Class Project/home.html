                        <p class="yt"><span>Mahatma Gandhi</span>, born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was an Indian independence activist and political leader who is widely regarded as the Father of the Nation in India. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, and studied law in London, England. Gandhi is known for his nonviolent philosophy of civil disobedience, which he used to lead India to independence from British rule. He was a key figure in the Indian National Congress and organized many nonviolent civil disobedience campaigns and protests, including the famous Salt March in 1930. Gandhi is also remembered for his principles of truth, nonviolence, and selfless service, which he referred to as Satyagraha. His life and work inspired civil rights and freedom movements around the world. Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by a Hindu nationalist who opposed his support for a united India that included both Hindus and Muslims.</p>

                        <span>Jawaharlal Nehru </span> was the first Prime Minister of independent India, serving from 1947 until his death in 1964. He was born on November 14, 1889, in Allahabad, India, and was a leading figure in the Indian independence movement.

After independence, he played a key role in shaping the country's political, economic, and social policies, emphasizing secularism, democracy, and social justice. Nehru's policies included the establishment of a mixed economy, promoting industrialization and land reforms, and investing in education and health care. He was also an advocate for non-alignment in international relations and a supporter of disarmament and world peace. Nehru's legacy as a visionary leader and architect of modern India is widely recognized and celebrated in India and around the world.

                        <p class="yyt"><span>Lal Bahadur Shastri</span> was an Indian politician and statesman who served as the second Prime Minister of India from 1964 to 1966. He was born on October 2, 1904, in Mughalsarai, Uttar Pradesh, India. Shastri was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement and was deeply influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's principles of non-violence and civil disobedience. He served as the Minister of Home Affairs in the Nehru government and played a key role in maintaining internal security and restoring peace during the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Shastri is best known for his slogan "Jai Jawan Jai Kisan" (Hail the Soldier, Hail the Farmer), which he coined to rally the nation's morale during the 1965 Indo-Pak War. Shastri is also remembered for his significant contributions to India's agricultural sector, including the White Revolution or Operation Flood, which aimed to increase milk production in the country. Shastri's sudden death in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in January 1966, remains shrouded in mystery and controversy. Nevertheless, he is widely regarded as an honest and humble leader who dedicated his life to serving the people of India.</p>
